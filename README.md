Repository to store files for BCI course in 2021

I didn't want to give my credit card information for this purpose only, so uploading photos doesn't work.
Also I had to comment cloudinary usage in code since Heroku was giving errors for it.
But I can say that when I was doing testings locally the image posting worked fine.
